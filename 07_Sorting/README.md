#Classification algorithms

In computing and mathematics a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list or a vector in a given sequence by an order relation, ie, the output result must be a permutation or rearrangement of the input that satisfies the relation Of given order. The most commonly used order relationships are the numerical order and the lexicographic order. Efficient programming is important to optimize the use of other algorithms (such as search and merge) that require ordered lists for quick execution. It is also useful for putting data in canonical form and for generating human readable results.

## Definition of the problem

Sorts a list from major to minor by means of comparisons and exchanges.

### Entry

List = [3, 6, 7, 4, 9, 2, 0, 8, 5, 1]

### Departure


list
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
